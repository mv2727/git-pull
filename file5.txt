Git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously without interfering with each other's changes. It tracks changes in source code during software development. GitHub, on the other hand, is a web-based platform that uses Git for version control and provides additional features such as issue tracking, project management, and collaboration tools.
